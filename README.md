# Vector Database
## Pinecone
### Overview
This project demonstrates how to integrate and utilize Pinecone, a high-performance vector database, for scalable and efficient similarity search and machine learning tasks. Pinecone allows you to store, manage, and search large-scale vector embeddings with low latency, making it ideal for use cases like recommendation systems, semantic search, and natural language processing (NLP) applications.

### Features
* **Scalable Vector Storage:** Efficiently store and manage millions or even billions of vector embeddings.
* **Real-Time Similarity Search:** Perform fast similarity searches over large datasets with minimal latency.
* **Flexible Integration:** Easily integrate with popular machine learning frameworks and embedding models.
* **Cloud-Native:** Operate at scale with Pinecone's fully managed, serverless infrastructure.

### Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

* A Pinecone account. Sign up here if you don't have one.
* Python 3.7 or later installed on your machine.
* An API key from Pinecone, which can be found in your Pinecone dashboard.

### Use Cases
* **Recommendation Systems:** Build real-time recommendation engines by searching for similar user or product embeddings.
* **Semantic Search:** Enable semantic search over large text corpora by searching for similar text embeddings.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Detect anomalies by identifying outliers in vector space.


## ChromaDB

### Overview
This project demonstrates how to integrate and use ChromaDB, a high-performance vector database optimized for storing, managing, and querying large-scale vector embeddings. ChromaDB is designed to support advanced machine learning applications, including similarity search, recommendation systems, and semantic search.

### Features
* **Efficient Vector Storage:** Seamlessly store and manage large collections of vector embeddings.
* **High-Performance Search:** Execute low-latency similarity searches over vast datasets.
* **Scalable and Flexible:** Easily handle growing data and integrate with various ML frameworks.
* **Open-Source:** Fully open-source solution with active community support.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* Python 3.7 or later installed on your machine.
* Basic understanding of vector embeddings and their use in machine learning.
* ChromaDB library installed (installation instructions provided below).

### Use Cases
* **Recommendation Systems:** Power recommendation engines by identifying similar items or users based on vector embeddings.
* **Semantic Search:** Enable semantic search functionalities by querying against text or image embeddings.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Detect outliers or anomalies in your data by leveraging vector distances.
